    <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Our Mission</h2>
    <p style="margin-top: 1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
        AI Activity Planner helps you maintain a balanced and active lifestyle by intelligently 
        scheduling your favorite activities throughout the week. Whether you're into running, 
        yoga, swimming, or any other activity, our AI-powered system creates personalized plans 
        that consider your preferences, fitness levels, and schedule constraints.

    <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">How It Works</h2>
    <div style="margin-top: 1rem;">
        <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">1. Log Your Activities</h3>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
            Add activities you enjoy with details like location, duration, intensity level, 
            and any dependencies (weather, equipment, etc.). The more information you provide, 
            the better your personalized plan will be.
        </p>
        
        <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">2. Connect Your Devices (Optional)</h3>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
            Integrate your Fitbit or Oura account to help the AI understand your activity 
            patterns and recovery needs. This allows for more accurate and personalized planning.
        </p>
        
        <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">3. Generate Your Weekly Plan</h3>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
            Our AI assistant, powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT, analyzes your activities and creates 
            a balanced weekly schedule. The plan considers intensity distribution, recovery time, 
            weather dependencies, and location requirements to ensure optimal results.
